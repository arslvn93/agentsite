# Plan to Update Brand Slider Images

The user wants to change the SVG images in the Swiper container under the testimonials (identified as `swiper swiper-initialized swiper-horizontal infiniteslide wrap-partners tf-spacing-7 pb-0`) to new image URLs.

## 1. Locate the Code
The Swiper container with the classes `swiper swiper-initialized swiper-horizontal infiniteslide wrap-partners tf-spacing-7 pb-0` was found in the file:
- [`components/common/BrandSlider2.jsx`](components/common/BrandSlider2.jsx)

## 2. Analyze the Structure
Upon examining [`components/common/BrandSlider2.jsx`](components/common/BrandSlider2.jsx), it was found that:
- The file contains a Swiper component.
- Inside the Swiper, there are multiple `SwiperSlide` components.
- Each of these currently renders an `<svg>...</svg>` block.
- There are 4 unique SVG logos that are repeated to create the infinite sliding effect. The approximate line numbers for the first instance of each unique SVG are:
    1. Lines 37-184
    2. Lines 187-479
    3. Lines 483-691
    4. Lines 695-959
- The user provided 4 new image URLs, which matches the number of unique SVGs.

## 3. Proposed Changes
The plan is to replace each of these unique SVG blocks (and their repetitions) with an `<img>` tag pointing to the new image URLs. The `width` and `height` attributes from the SVGs (`width={180}` `height={100}`) will be applied to the new `<img>` tags for consistency, along with appropriate `alt` text.

Specifically:

1.  The **first unique SVG** (e.g., lines 37-184 and its repeat at lines 963-1110) will be replaced by:
    ```html
    <img src="https://salesgenius.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/websiteimages/logos/RECO_1.jpg" alt="RECO Logo" width={180} height={100} />
    ```
2.  The **second unique SVG** (e.g., lines 187-479 and its repeat at lines 1113-1395) will be replaced by:
    ```html
    <img src="https://salesgenius.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/websiteimages/logos/treb_logo_white_1.png" alt="TREB Logo" width={180} height={100} />
    ```
3.  The **third unique SVG** (e.g., lines 483-691 and its repeat at lines 1409-1617) will be replaced by:
    ```html
    <img src="https://salesgenius.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/websiteimages/logos/realtor-logo-png-transparent_1.png" alt="Realtor Logo" width={180} height={100} />
    ```
4.  The **fourth unique SVG** (e.g., lines 695-959 and its repeat at lines 1747-1886) will be replaced by:
    ```html
    <img src="https://salesgenius.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/websiteimages/logos/orea-logo_1.png" alt="OREA Logo" width={180} height={100} />
    ```

## 4. Visual Plan

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start: User Request] --> B{Identify Component: BrandSlider2.jsx};
    B --> C{Analyze: Found 4 unique SVGs, repeated};
    C --> D{Match: 4 new image URLs provided};
    D --> E{Plan: Replace each unique SVG (and its repeats) with an <img /> tag};
    E --> F{Details: Use new URLs, apply width=180, height=100, add alt text};
    F --> G[Present Plan to User for Review];
    G -- User Approves --> H{Switch to Code Mode};
    H --> I[Implement Changes];
    I --> J[End Task];
    G -- User Requests Changes --> E;
```

## 5. Next Steps
After user confirmation of this plan, the next step is to switch to "Code" mode to implement these changes.
